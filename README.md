## Introduction

The Ichimoku Trading Bot leverages the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo indicator, a popular technical analysis tool used to identify trends and potential trading opportunities in the financial markets.

This bot connects to the Binance API, which provides access to real-time market data and allows for the execution of trades. By integrating the Ichimoku indicator with the Binance API, the bot can automatically analyze market conditions and place trades based on predefined strategies.
